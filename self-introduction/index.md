Self-introduction

Hello! My name is Denis. I want to be a junior frontend developer.
I am 33 years old. I was born in Saint-Petersburg and I have lived all my life here.
I graduated from the State Polytechnical University in 2012 with a specialty in Electrical engineering. I received masterâ€™s degree. I am currently attending the RS School frontend course.
Programming languages follow me throughout my life.
I studied Turbo Pascal at school. I figured out how to use matrices and algorithms.
I studied Fortran at university. Solved tasks with derivatives and integrals.
I studied C++ during the pandemic. I thought it would help me automate my current tasks. But I realized that simpler solutions would be suitable for solving my problems.
As a result, I concluded that without a roadmap or mentor, I would not become a software developer.
I started looking for solutions.
The first question that needs an answer: What programming language should I study?
I wanted to see the result of my work immediately on the screen, and not in the console or a simple interface. I needed a popular programming language that had powerful support from both tutorials and forums.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything else related to frontend development satisfied the requirements.
The second question: where can I study?
I have read reviews of various paid and free courses, mentors. Most of them had both positive and negative comments. But only one had only positive reviews: The Rolling Scopes School.
I chose it and started studying.
The first big task was called "Portfolio". It consisted of three stages: fixed layout, adaptive layout, adding functionality using JavaScript. I used semantic HTML and CSS Flexible Box to build a website. I did the switching of themes, language, images using JavaScript. The value of the current theme and language is stored in the local storage. This allows you to save the language and theme when reload the page.
The second big task was called "Shelter". Already having experience, I used semantic HTML, BEM methodology, CSS Flexible Box, CSS Grid, SASS to build a website. I did carousel and pagination without duplicate elements, popup using JavaScript.
The third big task was called " RSS Virtual Keyboard". I applied all my knowledge in this task. I also used Webpack. It is good helper for such tasks. Mouse clicks on buttons of the virtual keyboard or pressing buttons on a physical keyboard inputs characters to the input field, switching keyboard layouts between English and Russian language.
Separately, I would like to mention the task "CSS Meme Slider". All functionality is built on pure CSS without using JavaScript.
You can see all my works on GitHub. I continue to study at the RS School. I'm going to refactor the code soon.
Thank you for watching this video till the end! Bye.
